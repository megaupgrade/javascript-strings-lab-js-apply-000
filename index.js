 ## Objectives
 1. Manipulate strings by hand in JavaScript
2. Practice interpolating with template literals
 You'll find a file called `strings.js` in this directory. Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to get tests to pass. You can run the tests using the `learn` command in your terminal or the Learn IDE. Give that a go now.
